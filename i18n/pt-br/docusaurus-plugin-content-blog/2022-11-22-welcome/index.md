Hello World!

It's been a great year with lots of improvements and new features and we know that documentation didn't follow-up.

The time has come! We are working in a brand new documentation website and we need help on migrating content from the old [certification page][1] into this one. **The goal is to have this done by the end of 2022**.

Are you up for the mission?

You are welcome to send us Pull Requests for adding or editing documentation modules and code snippets that you might have stored somewhere within your project files, postman collections and Teams messages.

Let's do this!
